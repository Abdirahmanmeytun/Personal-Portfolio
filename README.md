# Abdirahman Abdiwahab — Portfolio

This repository contains a modern & minimal multi-page portfolio site for **Abdirahman Abdiwahab** (Cloud Engineer & IT Specialist). Pages are static HTML + CSS and easy to host on GitHub Pages.

## Live demo
(After you publish on GitHub Pages add the URL here.)

## Files
- `index.html` — Home
- `about.html` — About & portrait
- `skills.html` — Skills
- `projects.html` — Projects
- `services.html` — Services
- `contact.html` — Contact (includes a simple form)
- `styles.css` — Shared styles
- `assets/` — Add your images here (logo, photo)

## How to use
1. Create a new GitHub repo (public).  
2. Copy the files into the repo root.  
3. Add your logo as `assets/logo.png` and your portrait as `assets/photo.jpg`.  
   - Use the logo and portrait generated earlier (or replace with your preferred images).
4. In `contact.html` update `your-email-here`, `your-linkedin-here`, and the Formspree `action` if you want a working form.  
5. Enable GitHub Pages on the repo (Settings → Pages → branch `main`/`master`) to publish.

## Customize
- Change colors & fonts in `styles.css`.  
- Add more projects or link to GitHub repos in `projects.html`.  
- Convert to a static site generator (Hugo/Jekyll) later if desired.
